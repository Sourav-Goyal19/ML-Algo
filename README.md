### ML Algo ‚Äì AI-Powered Interactive Machine Learning Visualization

**ML Algo** is an innovative platform designed to simplify the understanding of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms through interactive visualizations powered by **Manim Python**. Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's engaging content style, ML Algo bridges the gap between complex mathematical theory and practical understanding, making ML learning more intuitive, engaging, and accessible.


### Why ML Algo?

Understanding ML algorithms often requires a deep dive into linear algebra, calculus, and statistics‚Äîsubjects that can be overwhelming for students and developers alike. While platforms like **3Blue1Brown** do a great job of visualizing pure math, there‚Äôs no dedicated space for visualizing *ML algorithms interactively*.

**ML Algo** fills this gap by providing:
- üß† **AI-powered explanations**
- üßÆ **Mathematical concept breakdowns**
- üìΩÔ∏è **Dynamic visualizations using Manim**
- üåê **User-friendly interface to query, explore, and understand algorithms visually**


###  Features

- ‚úÖ **Interactive ML Concept Visualizations**  
  Using Manim Python to animate everything from Gradient Descent to Decision Trees.

- üß† **AI-Generated Explanations**  
  Just input a query like "Explain Logistic Regression", and the platform takes care of the rest‚Äîexplanation + animation.

- üìÅ **Custom Query Support**  
  Users can customize what algorithm or concept they want visualized.

- üîÅ **Dataset Integration (Coming Soon)**  
  Upload datasets and watch how algorithms work on real data, animated in real time.

- üîä **Narrated Animations**  
  Google Text-to-Speech is used to provide audio explanations alongside visuals.

- üåç **Live Map Visualizations (For Address Correction Use Cases)**  
  For projects like postal address validation and ML-backed correction suggestions.
